To accomplish that aim, you must typically wrestle with facts and truths that will rattle you. No one experiences a great number of serious Plutonian transits or progressions to the Sun in the course of a lifetime. The decisive players here are the progressed Sun itself, the solar arc Pluto, and the transiting Pluto. None of them move very fast. If it weren’t for the network of aspectual trigger points that the natal Sun and natal Pluto spread throughout the chart, it would be easy for a life to go by without any interaction between these energies. As it is, they’ll certainly make a few contacts, at least through aspects. A minor player in this category of astrological event is any contact of the transiting Sun with the natal Pluto. In the course of any year, the Sun will buzz through every possible aspect to everything in the chart. While the basic issues remain the same, they are here robbed of much of their significance by the brevity of the event. In practice, I’d encourage you only to pay serious attention to the transiting Sun when there are other, more pithy Plutonian energies afoot. Then it may function as a useful timer, triggering events that epitomize the larger issues or bring them to a head. Those larger Sun-Pluto issues revolve around the sheer pagan desire for heat in one’s life. What fear stands between you and a fuller, more vital existence? Are you scared to admit hard truths about your marriage, your job, your religion, your family, your children, your sexuality, your health? How much are you paying for your attachment to your social standing? Your money? Your illusions? Questions such as those are not for the fainthearted, but when Pluto and the Sun make contact, those are the kinds of fundamental self-scrutinies that must be accepted. If they are faced, there will be gnashing of teeth...and liberation, perhaps after a “descent into hell.” If one does not possess the moral courage to observe one’s own life with that kind of shattering penetration, then we collapse into the classic dark-Plutonian scenario: the reenactment of whatever drama wounded us in the first place. We explored this notion thoroughly in the earliest chapters of this book. Here we find the abused child growing up and hitting his or her own kid — or arranging to get abused again by taking a job working for a gentleman who spent his last incarnation as an S.S. officer. Or the abandoned child betraying her own friend or lover. Or the person whose mother smoked a pack a day throughout her pregnancy who goes to work for the environmentally-crooked mining company, helping with the cover-ups. It’s the dark law of the unconscious Pluto: the deadening repetition of the horror, further spreading the virus."

The reason is very simple: the two bodies simply don’t like each other very much. Pluto is hard, relentless, and demanding. Even brutal. The Moon, on the other hand, is the center of all our emotional sensitivity and vulnerability. So: the nerve-endings meet the dentist’s drill, and it’s not necessarily a happy rendezvous. Which is not to say that it cannot lead to positive, life-enhancing outcomes. Even to ecstatic outcomes. The key concept in Moon-Pluto events, at least at first, is moodiness. Material is surfacing from the substrata of the psyche...Plutonian material, which is to say, material that we have had reason to suppress or repress. It comes at us through the Moon, which means that we feel it before we think it — hence, the “moodiness” associated with these events. We are registering in our Moon/Mood some unsettling information that will change our course through life. The information we are receiving can potentially enhance our happiness, since happiness is the nurturing Moon’s domain — but many times the means to that end is that the data tells us what is making us unhappy. Sometimes learning the source of our unhappiness is a very jarring experience. If you are pretending to be happy in your job, your friendships, relationships, religion, whatever, a Pluto-Moon event will try to reveal that fact to you. This notion of “pretending to be happy” may seem odd and pointless, but many times we humans are willing to pay a terrible price simply to avoid rocking the boat. Should such a circumstance apply, when the Moon-Pluto contact occurs, an unnamed mood of discontent will arise. If you commit yourself to honesty and follow that mood where it leads you, you will learn what you need to know in order to restore a self-nurturing quality to your life. If you don’t make that commitment and follow through on it, then you’ll simply experience a rotten mood that peaks as long as the progression or transit lasts...and then endures indefinitely as a dull, numb feeling — a “resolution to be dead,” as a therapist friend of mine phrases it."

Pluto, at least at first, is about unsettling or troubling insights… and later about the fiery visions that give renewed meaning and direction to life. Thus, when Pluto-Mercury contacts occur through transit or progression, they signal the arrival of data we might prefer to ignore. In fact, the central challenge here is to see what is actually before our eyes — and the most relevant piece of cautionary folklore is the notion that “what a fool believes, he sees.” Under these kinds of events, books are thrust upon us that give us the eerie feeling that the author has been spying on us for a decade or two. Friends offer throwaway lines that leave us insomniac at four a.m. Parents casually reveal shocking childhood tales about themselves or ourselves. Always, the challenge is to accept the reality of the incongruent information, and to begin to re-weave the tapestry of reality in its light. In a nutshell, passing Mercury/Pluto contacts suggest a season of near-shamanistic seeing and listening… purely phenomenological, unjudgmental, and open. And as alert as a nerve-ending. The relatively fleeting transits of Mercury through aspects to the natal Pluto do carry the significance we’ve just explored, but in a watered-down way. They are too brief to develop much meaning unless there are other, slower Mercury-Pluto developments occurring simultaneously. What we are mainly concerned with here are the transits or solar arcs of Pluto itself through aspects to the natal Mercury, or progressions or arcs of Mercury to aspects of the natal Pluto."

        detail: "When Venus and Pluto interact through a transit or a progression, it is truth-time. What is real must be honored, sometimes at the expense of peace, kindness, or stability. Two lovers gaze fixedly into each other’s eyes. Something in them melts; they hug. It’s eternal — and glorious. But look carefully: why do they hug? The simple answer — they love each other — is only part of the truth. Another part isn’t usually discussed: long exposure to that kind of total psychic nakedness is extremely uncomfortable. We enjoy a taste, then we ground it out in the primeval, physical comfort of touch. The dance of love always involves that kind of ambivalence: closeness — and walls against the closeness. We may love each other. But we hurt each other too, and frustrate each other, and annoy each other. The whole stew of forces makes itself felt in the alternating flow of closeness and space that exists even in the healthiest and most satisfying of bonds. Even in the most benign of circumstances, when Venus and Pluto interact, it is a sign that those distancing devices have grown stale. Deeper layers of one’s humanness must be revealed, however traumatic that process may be. Needs must be expressed, anxieties and fears explored. And passion regained. Under such moving aspects we must also be alert to the basic Plutonian paradigm: it may now be time to look at a wounded place connected with one’s capacity to love, to trust, or fully to inhabit one’s natural sexual vitality. In the most mentally inert version of the tale, we simply reproduce old wounding patterns of childhood or karma. In more conscious versions, we are presented with someone who tempts us with the triggering of the old program — but we see through the illusion and break the chain. The relatively fleeting transits of Venus through aspects to the natal Pluto carry the significance we’ve just explored, but in a milder fashion. They are too brief to develop much meaning unless there are other, slower Venus-Pluto developments occurring simultaneously. What mainly deserves our attention here are the transits or solar arcs of Pluto itself through aspects to the natal Venus, or progressions of Venus to aspects of the natal Pluto. One more image: in Celtic mythology, the doors that offered access to the world of Faerie opened only on certain nights of the year. It’s that way in human love, too. There are moments that must be recognized and claimed, or they pass. Some of these special “nights of the year” are signaled by soft contacts of Venus and Pluto. In the case of the brief passages of transiting Venus through an aspect to Pluto, the “night” may be literally that — one night. In the slower, more important moving events, the “special night” might last a couple of years. Still, particular moments of magical intensity during those long cycles can often be recognized through “minor” events such as Venus transiting through a trine to natal Pluto."

        detail: "Transits or progressions that temporarily link Pluto and Mars provide real crossroads in life. We can use them to enter new existential superhighways, full of blazing emotional engagement — or as exit ramps from highways that have grown dull and featureless. One purpose such events do not serve: they’re not likely to help you win any popularity contests. These are “me” seasons, quite naturally and legitimately. Desires are inherently ego-centered energies; they’re always framed in terms of “I want...” It may be “I want a grand piano and I am going to get one, period.” Or it may be “I want to join the Peace Corps and to try to help starving children in Ecuador.” The second desire is more certifiably “noble,” but read the fine print: The person who has determined to join the Peace Corps is going to leave her dog with mom and dad, her roommate looking for a Single White Female, her boyfriend wondering if it was his breath... Even the loftiest of intentions, once enacted, rocks a lot of boats. And that’s inevitably a side-effect of Pluto-Mars times in one’s life. Careers are changed, relationships are made or broken, addresses cross state lines, irrevocable commitments are made. And the pieces fall into place as best they can. When handled in a conscious way, the desires that underlie such a period are genuine ones, rooted in a person’s spiritual journey. That alone justifies a lot of broken eggs. But when a person responds poorly to such Mars-Pluto interactions, the passions released are awry. We fervently imagine we want something that, in fact, we do not want at all. The desire is for a symbol, and what it symbolizes is some forgotten thing we needed long ago but were prevented from attaining. Fast transits of Mars through aspects to the natal Pluto carry the spirit of what we’ve just explored, but in a diluted way. They are too brief to develop much meaning unless there are other, slower Mars-Pluto developments occurring simultaneously. What we are mainly concerned with here are the transits or solar arcs of Pluto itself through aspects to the natal Mars, or progressions of Mars to aspects of the natal Pluto."

No clearer astrological signal that it is time to move can exist. Tying Jupiter to Pluto links opportunity to desire, vision to intensity, self-confidence to a willingness to upset the apple cart. Gentleness is a precious part of life, but it is not particularly relevant to either of these planets, especially Pluto. Seizing destiny, claiming more territory for oneself, expanding one’s bubble...these extensions are often greeted with mixed responses from the people around us. We may hear a chorus of “ouches.” Earlier, we used an illustration of a young single mother, penniless but determined, who puts herself through law school at night. Perhaps when she came to that decision, she was experiencing some moving contact of Jupiter and Pluto. She was sick of her narrow life, sick of poverty, sick of hopelessness — and willing to seize a chance to claim more for herself and her child. But to succeed in law school she would have to spend less time with her youngster, less time with her friends and family. Probably, they all squawk a bit. More darkly, it is not difficult to imagine “stuck” people who find her bid to improve herself threatening, and who seek to undermine her resolve with shame, criticism, and doomsaying. “To hell with them,” our single mother may say to herself. The sentiment might not be lofty, but it is not without Plutonian wisdom either. Under these contacts, bright new possibilities must be seized or life grows as stale and limiting as a prison cell. Jupiter’s transits through aspects to the natal Pluto are slow enough that they can indeed develop real significance. In this, they are different from all the planets we’ve explored so far. To them, we also must add to our considerations the solar-arcs of Jupiter to Pluto, or the solar-arcs or transits of Pluto to Jupiter. What we sacrifice are the secondary progressions; neither Pluto nor Jupiter move far enough in the course of a lifetime to be of much practical value there."

Some of us may hear it ominously, others encouragingly. And both possibilities are on the radar screen when Pluto links to Saturn through transit or solar arc. Either way, there is a D-day sense about these two planets coming together. It’s a make it or break it time in which a certain confrontation, both with oneself and with circumstance, has taken on a quality of inevitability or “fate.” Pluto is our craziness, insofar as we are all made “crazy” by the unconscious material that influences our behavior and view of life — the compass-turning “beer cans” of which we spoke early in the book. And when Pluto forms a moving link with Saturn, we are ready to confront and defeat our craziness in a decisive battle, thereby creating an existential turning point for ourselves. That’s the “cosmic paycheck;” if we’ve earned it, now we collect it. But what if we’ve been overindulging in denial, projection, and laziness? What kind of paycheck can we expect then? Here, we see the dark side of Pluto-Saturn possibilities: the craziness we’ve carried inside us crystallizes in our biographical life. Our worst fear comes true.

        detail: "Speed and surprise almost always figure in the events symbolized by interactions of Uranus and Pluto. When transits or solar arcs bring these planets into contact with each other, we rarely have much time to think. As a result, they tend to be extremely revealing of our character, our true psychospiritual condition, and our actual priorities and agendas. The heart of the matter is to realize that much Plutonian truth is held in check simply by social programming. That programming takes two forms, each equally potent. The first is our internalized, often unconscious, training in “goodness” or “normalcy.” The second is the present web of interpersonal or communal constraints that bind us. When Uranus enters the picture, the power of all that social programming diminishes. We are typically filled with emotions that are conveyed well by the words, “Why, for two cents I’d...” The “Plutonian truth” that is liberated by Uranian contact also takes a couple of forms. The first has to do with unconscious, unprocessed material: old angers, humiliations, and violations. Those emotions tend to surface explosively and unpredictably under this kind of stimulus. They may emerge in ways that are aimed truly — “Dad, shut up.” Or they may be wildly off the mark — we are suddenly assailed by the full magnitude of our anger toward a domineering father, but we don’t understand the real source of the emotion, instead taking it out on other drivers, our co-workers, the family dog. The second expression of Plutonian truth, as it is liberated by Uranian contact, pertains to sudden risings-to-consciousness of what we really want or need. This can be as shocking to ourselves as it is to those around us, but it is part of an inherently healthy process. “Jack, I’m tired of the city. Let’s quit our jobs and move to New Hampshire.” Or: “I just can’t stomach going to Mass anymore.” Or: “I don’t care about the impracticality, I’ve got to have a quarter horse.”"

The idea is exaggerated of course, but not as negative or even as simple-minded as it sounds. Here is the deeper logic behind it: Neptune is fundamentally a planet that refers to our capacity to navigate inner space. As such, when it is stimulated, our awareness of subtle intuitions is heightened. Neptunian events coincide with an intensification of our capacity to visualize and imagine, and an extension of our faculty of concentration on those interior landscapes. In other words, Neptune excels at helping us improve a wide range of skills that are extraordinarily useful when it comes to mapping our inner topography and receiving inspiration and insight. Such inner developments have profound indirect relevance to decision-making and action. But when they are the focus of attention, our intelligence is not directed toward the outer, material world, nor should it be. We are adjusted optimally for the navigational requirements of another world entirely — the inner one. Which means that we are prone to dumb moves in the outer realm of events. Hence, the dictum: don’t do anything. With Pluto in the picture, Neptunian visualizations and realizations may take on the tonality of any psychic woundedness we have not yet integrated. No matter what the aspect, this is a powerful time for intuitive self-discovery in those uncomfortable areas. Methods involving symbols are particularly productive then: Tarot cards, dream work, and astrology, for example. As we advance, the higher, happier dimensions of Pluto come into focus: images pop into the mind regarding inspiring new directions and possibilities in one’s life, promising deeper degrees of emotional engagement and authenticity. Again, the triggering agent for these liberating images may well be symbolism of some sort. But even there, we must be cautious. These Neptunian inspirations are probably not ready to be enacted as they are visualized. They come into consciousness packaged as metaphors and archetypes — Neptune stuff. Invariably, they require grounding, horse-sensical scrutiny, and compromise."
