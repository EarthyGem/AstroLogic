This designation is called its Degree of Emanation. The first sign of a triplicity in the zodiac belongs to the first degree of emanation, the second sign to the second degree of emanation, and the third sign to the third degree of emanation. The signs of the First Degree of Emanation are Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer. People born under these signs act from motives that chiefly spring from their own feelings, ideas, and inward yearnings. When expressing themselves they tend to externalize their own inner nature with LIBERTY. The signs of the second Degree of Emanation are Leo, Virgo, Libra, and Scorpio. People born under these signs act from their own feelings, ideas, and inward yearnings, tempered by a full consideration of what other people feel, think, and advise. When expressing themselves they tend to externalize their own inner nature with MODIFICATION. The signs of the Third Degree of Emanation are Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. People born under these signs act less from their own feelings, ideas, and inward yearnings, than from ideas and attitudes that have reached them from without. When expressing themselves they tend to externalize their own inner nature with RESERVE."
